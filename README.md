# PHYS475
## Computational Physics using Python

This is part of the "Topics in Applied Physics" course. The subject of the course is Computational Physics using Python. The course will provide an introduction to the numerical implementation of mathematical techniques such as integration and differentiation, solution of linear and nonlinear equations, solution of ordinary and partial differential equations, stochastic processes, and Monte Carlo methods. There will also be focus on application of techniques to simulate real-world physical problems such as planetary motion, oscillatory motion, electronic circuit components, waves, and quantum mechanics. You will learn and use Python programming language for computational physics.

Each lecture will be supported by example codes and additional materials, that will be posted in this Github repository, as a jupyter notebook (.ipynb format).

Please install Python and other supporting libraries. Go through Lecture 1 for help.

During the class, download individual files from the repository and run it locally on your computer. You will be asked to run example codes, edit/modify/ammend code blocks and learn via hands-on session during the lecture.

All assignments associated with the lectures and final projects must be submitted on Blackboard (see syllabus for more information).
